# Feature Selection using Quantum Computing

## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a novel approach to feature selection leveraging Quantum Annealing (QA) for Machine Learning (ML). Feature Selection (FS) is a pivotal task in ML, aimed at identifying the most relevant variables for building predictive models. By reducing the dimensionality of data, we can improve model performance and reduce computational costs.

## Overview

The notebook explores the potential of Quantum Computing (QC) in enhancing FS processes. The proposed method uses the power of QA to navigate the complex search space of FS more effectively than traditional methods. The development of this QC-based FS method involved experimentation and validation across various datasets, including wine quality, insurance, and Bike Sharing System (BSS) data. The results demonstrate the method's superiority in achieving higher predictive accuracy with fewer features, thus simplifying models and enhancing computational efficiency.
